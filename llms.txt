# eva3dm

## Introduction

An R-package focusing on **EVA**luation of **3D** weather and air
quality **M**odels, streamlining the entire workflow from data
preparation to post-processing, statistical analysis, and visualization
**\[1\]**.

Whether you’re working with meteorological models like WRF or evaluating
air quality simulations (WRF-Chem, CAMx, WACCM, etc), eva3dm provides a
comprehensive toolkit to handle observational data, model outputs, and
evaluation metrics in an efficient and reproducible manner. Key
Features: - Pre-processing of observational and model data -
Post-processing tools for extracting time-series, calculating derived
variables (e.g., accumulated rain, humidity variables and wind
variables), and preparing data for analysis - Statistical and
categorical model evaluation - Custom plotting tools for spatial data
and georeferencing evaluation results - Integration with other packages
like `terra`, `ncdf4`, `qualR`, `riem` and `openair`

## Instalation

Open a R session and type the following command on the terminal to
install the official version from CRAN:

`install.packages("eva3dm")`

the last version can be installed directly from github (using the
`remotes` package, in this example):

`remotes::install_github("schuch666/eva3dm")`

All the functions include examples in the
[documentation](https://schuch666.github.io/eva3dm/).

## Recomended Workflow

The following workflow is recommended:

**1. Pre-processing of observations**:

- Download of observations, time-series of meteorological variables can
  be obtained from the METAR (METeorological Aerodrome Report) from
  Automated Surface Observing System/Automated Weather Observing System
  (ASOS/AWOS) can be downloaded using the R-package
  [riem](https://docs.ropensci.org/riem/), or via the [Iowa State
  University](https://mesonet.agron.iastate.edu/request/download.phtml)
  website and METAR data from Integrated Surface Database (ISD) can be
  downloaded using the R-package
  [worldmet](https://openair-project.github.io/worldmet/) or the [NOAA
  Global hourly
  ISD](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/land-based-station/integrated-surface-database)
  website, time-series of pollutant concentrations from Brazil can be
  downloaded using the R-package
  [qualR](https://github.com/ropensci/qualR), or
  [QUALAR](https://qualar.cetesb.sp.gov.br/qualar) and
  [MonitorAir](https://www.data.rio/datasets/dados-hor%C3%A1rios-do-monitoramento-da-qualidade-do-ar-monitorar/explore)
  sites, and a range of satellite products are available at [NASA
  giovanni](https://giovanni.gsfc.nasa.gov/giovanni/) website.

- QA of the observation data.

- Process observation data for evaluation.

- Process of site-list if plan to extract time-series from the model.

**2. Pre-processing of model output**: Extraction and pre-processing of
model outputs;

**3. Model Evaluation**: The functions
[`eva()`](https://schuch666.github.io/eva3dm/reference/eva.md) (to
evaluate time-series) and
[`sat()`](https://schuch666.github.io/eva3dm/reference/sat.md) (to
evaluate against satellite products) can be used to perform statistical
(more details in
[`stat()`](https://schuch666.github.io/eva3dm/reference/stat.md)) and
categorical (more details in
[`cate()`](https://schuch666.github.io/eva3dm/reference/cate.md))
evaluation;

**4. Visualization**: try some of the visualization functions from this
package or other packages.

**The function
[`template()`](https://schuch666.github.io/eva3dm/reference/template.md)
can help to setup folders and scripts from steps 1-4 for different
models, observations datasets and evaluation types.**
